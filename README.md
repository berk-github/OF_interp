Hi, 

Working sample code of an optical-flow based interpolation framework. Analytical dataset code is included in the script.

As of today 12/4/2018, the uploaded script is functional but lacking clear comments. It may also contain some redundant code. In the upcoming days, I'll be cleaning the code for better readibility and adding comments for clarification. Sorry for the inconvenience.
